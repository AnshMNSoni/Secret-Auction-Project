# Secret-Auction-Project

Project Overview:

The Secret Auction System allows multiple users to participate in an auction without knowing each other’s bid amounts.

Here’s a quick rundown of how it works:
-> User Interaction: Each participant is prompted to enter their name and bid amount.

-> Privacy Assurance: After entering their bid, the system asks if there are any other participants. If the answer is yes, the console is cleared to ensure that the next participant cannot see the previous bids. This maintains the confidentiality of each bid.

-> Continued Bidding: This process repeats until all users have placed their bids.
